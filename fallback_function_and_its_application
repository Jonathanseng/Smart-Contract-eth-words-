In Ethereum, a fallback function is a function that is executed when a contract receives a transaction that does not match any of its defined functions. The fallback function is defined using the fallback keyword in the contract code, and can be used for a variety of purposes.

One common use case for the fallback function is to implement a "payable" function, which allows the contract to receive Ether (the cryptocurrency used on the Ethereum network) without a specific function call. This is useful for accepting donations or payments from users who may not know the specific function they need to call to interact with the contract.

Another use case for the fallback function is to implement a "catch-all" function that can handle any unexpected inputs to the contract. This can be useful for adding additional flexibility and error-handling to a contract.

It's worth noting that in newer versions of Solidity (the programming language used to write Ethereum contracts), the fallback function has been replaced with a "receive" function, which serves a similar purpose but is more explicit in its functionality.
