In the context of computer hardware and computer architecture, a slot is a physical connection or expansion port on a computer's motherboard or other circuit board that is used to connect additional components to the system.

One common example of a slot is the PCI Express (PCIe) slot, which is used to connect expansion cards such as graphics cards, sound cards, or network cards to a computer's motherboard. Other types of slots include RAM slots, CPU sockets, and hard drive bays.

In the context of software development, the term "slot" is also used in some programming languages and frameworks, such as Qt, to refer to a placeholder in a user interface that can be filled with content or functionality at runtime. Slots in this context are often used in event-driven programming, where a program responds to user interactions or other events by executing a specific function or block of code.
