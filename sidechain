In the context of blockchain technology, a sidechain refers to a separate blockchain that runs in parallel to the main blockchain (also known as the parent chain). The main purpose of a sidechain is to allow for the transfer of assets or data between the two blockchains in a secure and efficient manner.

Sidechains are often used to address the scalability issues that can arise with the main blockchain. By transferring some transactions to a sidechain, the main blockchain can process more transactions per second and reduce network congestion.

One example of a sidechain is the Liquid Network, which is a Bitcoin sidechain designed for fast and confidential transactions between exchanges and other institutions. Another example is the RSK (Rootstock) sidechain, which enables smart contracts on the Bitcoin network.

Overall, sidechains provide a way to extend the functionality of the main blockchain and offer new use cases for blockchain technology.
