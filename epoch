In computing, an epoch is a fixed point in time used as a reference for measuring time intervals or representing a specific point in time.

The term epoch is commonly used in operating systems, databases, and other software applications to represent a specific point in time, often measured in seconds or milliseconds since a specific fixed point in time, such as the Unix epoch. The Unix epoch is defined as January 1, 1970, at 00:00:00 UTC, and is a widely used reference point for measuring time in Unix-based operating systems and many other applications.

Epochs are often used to represent dates and times in a standardized and machine-readable format, such as Unix timestamps, which represent the number of seconds since the Unix epoch. This allows for easy manipulation and comparison of dates and times by software applications.

Epochs can also be used in blockchain systems to represent the time at which a particular block was mined or a transaction was executed. This allows for easy verification and synchronization of blockchain data across multiple nodes in the network.

In summary, an epoch is a reference point in time that is used to measure time intervals or represent a specific point in time in computing systems.
