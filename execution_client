It's not entirely clear what you mean by "execution client." However, I'll provide a couple of interpretations and explanations:

In the context of finance and trading, an execution client is a type of client that works with a broker or trading firm to execute trades. This could refer to an individual investor who hires a broker to place trades on their behalf, or it could refer to an institutional client (such as a hedge fund or asset manager) that works with a trading desk to execute large trades.

In software development, an execution client could refer to a component of a distributed system that receives requests and executes them on behalf of a user or application. For example, in a client-server architecture, the client might send a request to the server, which then forwards the request to an execution client that runs the necessary code and returns the result to the server.

If you could provide more context or information about the specific context in which you encountered the term "execution client," I could provide a more precise answer.
