A Finney is a unit of measurement for the value of a cryptocurrency, specifically for the cryptocurrency Ethereum. It is named after Hal Finney, a computer scientist and early Bitcoin contributor who was the first person to receive a Bitcoin transaction.

One Finney is equal to 0.001 Ether (ETH), which is currently the smallest unit of Ether that can be displayed in most wallets and exchanges. Therefore, 1 ETH is equal to 1,000 Finneys.

The Finney unit is not as commonly used as other units of measurement for Ether, such as Wei, Gwei, and Ether itself. However, it can be useful for expressing smaller amounts of Ether, such as in micropayments or in cases where precision is important.

It is worth noting that the value of a Finney, as with any other unit of cryptocurrency, can fluctuate based on market conditions and other factors that affect the value of the underlying cryptocurrency.
