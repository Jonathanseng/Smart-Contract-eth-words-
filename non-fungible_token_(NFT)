A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique digital asset that is verified using blockchain technology, which is the same technology that underpins cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Unlike cryptocurrencies, which are fungible and can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies of equal value, NFTs are unique and cannot be exchanged for other tokens on a one-to-one basis.

NFTs are typically used to represent digital art, music, videos, or other creative works, allowing creators to sell their works as one-of-a-kind items. NFTs contain information about the creator, the date of creation, and any other relevant information that might be associated with the asset.

NFTs have gained popularity in recent years, with some selling for millions of dollars at auctions. While some view NFTs as a promising new frontier for artists and creators to monetize their work, others criticize them as being a speculative bubble and a potential environmental hazard due to the energy consumption of blockchain technology.
