In Solidity, the concept of difficulty refers to the measure of how hard it is to mine a new block in the blockchain. The difficulty level is adjusted automatically by the Ethereum network to maintain a constant block mining time of approximately 13-15 seconds.

There is no specific Solidity code for difficulty, as it is a network-level variable that is managed by the Ethereum protocol. However, smart contracts can interact with the difficulty variable by accessing the block.difficulty property, which returns the current difficulty level.

Here's an example Solidity code that uses the block.difficulty property:
