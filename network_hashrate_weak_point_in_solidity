Solidity is a programming language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The network hashrate, on the other hand, refers to the total computational power being used to mine new blocks and maintain the security of the blockchain network.

It's important to note that Solidity itself does not have a weak point in relation to network hashrate. Instead, the security of a smart contract depends on the underlying blockchain network's security, which is largely determined by its hashrate.

If the network hashrate is low, it becomes easier for attackers to launch a 51% attack, which is when a group of miners control over 50% of the network's computational power and can potentially manipulate transactions or double-spend coins. This could lead to a smart contract being compromised, as attackers may be able to execute malicious code or steal funds.

Therefore, it is important for a blockchain network to maintain a high hashrate to ensure the security of its smart contracts. Additionally, developers should also follow best practices when writing smart contracts to minimize vulnerabilities and reduce the risk of exploits.
