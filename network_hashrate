In the context of blockchain networks, the network hashrate refers to the total amount of computational power that is being used to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. Hashrate is measured in hashes per second (H/s), kilohashes per second (KH/s), megahashes per second (MH/s), gigahashes per second (GH/s), or terahashes per second (TH/s), depending on the level of computational power being used.

The hashrate of a network is an important metric that reflects the security and efficiency of the network. A higher hashrate means that there are more miners or nodes on the network working to validate transactions and secure the network. This makes it more difficult for attackers to perform a 51% attack or double spend, which could compromise the integrity of the blockchain.

The hashrate of a blockchain network can vary depending on factors such as the popularity of the network, the reward mechanism for miners, and the cost and availability of mining hardware. The hashrate can also fluctuate over time as more or fewer miners join or leave the network, or as the mining difficulty adjusts to maintain a stable block production rate.

Overall, the network hashrate is an important metric for blockchain networks, as it reflects the level of security and efficiency of the network and affects the stability and reliability of the blockchain.
