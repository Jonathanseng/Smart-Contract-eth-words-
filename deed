A deed is a legal document that transfers ownership of property or land from one person or entity to another. It is a written instrument that is signed, witnessed, and delivered by the grantor (the person or entity transferring ownership) to the grantee (the person or entity receiving ownership).

Deeds are commonly used in real estate transactions, where they are used to transfer ownership of a property from a seller to a buyer. They may also be used to transfer ownership of other types of assets, such as vehicles or personal property.

In addition to transferring ownership, a deed may also contain other provisions, such as restrictions on how the property can be used or a warranty of title, which guarantees that the grantor has the right to transfer ownership and that there are no liens or other claims against the property.
