The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a decentralized naming system built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to register human-readable domain names (such as "myname.eth") that can be used to represent complex, hard-to-remember addresses (such as cryptocurrency wallet addresses).

ENS provides a secure, censorship-resistant way to link domain names to blockchain addresses, IPFS hashes, and other types of decentralized content. This makes it easier for users to interact with decentralized applications (dapps) and send cryptocurrencies without having to remember long, complicated strings of characters.

To use ENS, users must first register a domain name through an ENS registrar, which involves paying a fee in Ether (the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum). Once a domain name is registered, it can be linked to any Ethereum address, including smart contracts.

ENS also allows for subdomains, which can be used to create more personalized, hierarchical naming systems. For example, a user could register the domain "myname.eth" and then create subdomains like "wallet.myname.eth" or "dapp.myname.eth" to represent different types of content.

Overall, ENS is a powerful tool for creating user-friendly interfaces to decentralized applications and making the decentralized web more accessible to mainstream users.
