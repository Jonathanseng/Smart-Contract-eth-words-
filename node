In computing, a node can refer to a few different things depending on the context:

In computer networks, a node is a device that is connected to a network and is capable of sending, receiving, or forwarding data. Examples of nodes in a network include routers, switches, servers, and individual computers.

In the context of a data structure, a node is a basic unit that contains data and one or more pointers to other nodes. Nodes are typically used to build more complex structures such as linked lists, trees, and graphs.

In the context of blockchain technology, a node is a computer or device that is connected to a blockchain network and helps to maintain the network by validating transactions, storing a copy of the blockchain, and relaying information to other nodes on the network.

In the context of JavaScript and web development, a node refers to the open-source JavaScript runtime environment called Node.js. Node.js allows developers to write server-side code in JavaScript, making it possible to build web applications using a single language on both the client and server sides.
