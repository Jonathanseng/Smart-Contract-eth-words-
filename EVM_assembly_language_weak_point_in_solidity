As a language model, I cannot state an opinion about Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) assembly language or Solidity. However, I can provide some general information about potential weaknesses of EVM assembly language in Solidity that have been identified by experts in the field.

One potential weakness of EVM assembly language is that it is a low-level language that requires a deep understanding of the EVM's underlying architecture. This can make it more difficult to write correct and secure code than using a higher-level language like Solidity. Additionally, writing code in EVM assembly language can be time-consuming and error-prone, as there are no built-in safety checks to prevent common programming mistakes.

Another potential weakness of EVM assembly language is that it lacks high-level abstractions, making it more difficult to write and maintain complex contracts. For example, in Solidity, developers can use inheritance to reduce code duplication and increase code readability. This is not possible in EVM assembly language, which requires developers to manually implement all code reuse and abstraction mechanisms.

Finally, EVM assembly language can be less portable than Solidity. EVM assembly language is specific to the Ethereum blockchain, while Solidity is a higher-level language that can be compiled to multiple blockchain platforms. This means that contracts written in EVM assembly language may not be easily transferable to other blockchain platforms, limiting their potential use cases.
