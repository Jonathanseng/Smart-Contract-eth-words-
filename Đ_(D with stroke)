In the Solidity programming language, the letter "Đ" (D with stroke) is not a valid character in identifier names.

Solidity follows the Unicode standard for identifier names, which specifies that an identifier name can only contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), underscores (_), and certain Unicode categories of letters that includes letters from many different languages, but not "Đ".

Therefore, you cannot use "Đ" in Solidity identifier names, such as variable names, function names, or contract names. If you attempt to use "Đ" in an identifier name, Solidity will throw a syntax error.
