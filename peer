In computing, a peer is a device or node on a network that has equal status with other devices or nodes on the same network. Peers communicate with each other to exchange information, resources, or services without the need for a centralized server or authority.

The concept of peers is used in various applications such as file sharing, content distribution, blockchain networks, and peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. In P2P networks, peers are connected to each other directly, forming a decentralized network without relying on a central server or authority. Each peer contributes resources such as bandwidth, processing power, or storage space, and can use the resources provided by other peers in the network.

The term "peer" can also refer to individuals who are part of a peer group or community, such as developers in a programming community or researchers in a scientific community. In this context, peers share common interests and expertise and collaborate with each other to achieve common goals or objectives. Peer-to-peer collaboration and knowledge-sharing can be facilitated by online platforms and communities that connect individuals with similar interests and expertise.
