Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks: In computer networking, a peer-to-peer network is a decentralized architecture where computers (peers) directly communicate and share resources with each other without a central server. P2P networks are used for file sharing, distributed computing, and decentralized applications (DApps) like blockchain.

Peer Review: Peer review is a critical evaluation process where experts in a particular field assess and provide feedback on research papers, articles, or proposals. It ensures the quality, validity, and credibility of scholarly work before it is published or accepted.

Peer Support: Peer support refers to individuals with shared experiences providing assistance, encouragement, and empathy to one another. It is often used in mental health settings, addiction recovery programs, and support groups to foster emotional well-being and resilience.

Peer Pressure: Peer pressure refers to the influence exerted by peers on an individual's behavior, attitudes, or decisions. It can be both positive and negative, impacting choices related to lifestyle, fashion, academic performance, or risky behaviors.

Peer Counseling: Peer counseling involves trained peers providing guidance, listening, and support to others facing personal challenges or difficulties. It is commonly used in schools, universities, and helpline services to offer confidential assistance.

Peer Recognition: Peer recognition programs acknowledge and appreciate the contributions and achievements of individuals within a group or organization. It fosters a positive work environment, boosts morale, and encourages collaboration.

In summary, the concept of "peer" finds applications in various domains, including networking, research, education, support systems, social influence, and workplace recognition. It emphasizes equality, collaboration, knowledge sharing, and mutual support among individuals of similar status or experiences.
