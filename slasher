"Slasher" generally refers to a subgenre of horror movies that typically involve a psychopathic killer who uses a sharp object (such as a knife or machete) to murder their victims. Slasher films typically involve a group of people who are being stalked and killed one by one by the killer. The genre became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with films like "Halloween," "Friday the 13th," and "A Nightmare on Elm Street." Today, the slasher genre remains a popular and influential subgenre of horror.
