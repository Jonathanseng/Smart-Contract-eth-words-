Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. It is used as a medium of exchange for paying transaction fees and as a reward for mining new blocks.

Ether can be bought and sold on cryptocurrency exchanges, and its value fluctuates based on market demand and supply. Its value can also be affected by factors such as network congestion, adoption of Ethereum by developers and users, and regulatory developments.

Ether is divisible up to 18 decimal places, with the smallest unit being called a wei. This allows for transactions of very small amounts of Ether, making it useful for micropayments and other use cases where small amounts of value are being exchanged.

Ether can also be used to interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum network. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into code. They can be used to automate processes, verify and enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract, or simply store information in a decentralized and tamper-proof manner.

In summary, Ether is a digital currency that serves as the backbone of the Ethereum blockchain, providing a means of exchange, store of value, and utility for smart contract interactions.
