In Ethereum, a "message" refers to a piece of data that is sent from one Ethereum account to another. Messages can be sent as part of a transaction on the Ethereum network, and can include information such as a recipient address, an amount of Ether or other tokens to transfer, and arbitrary data.

Messages can be sent between accounts on the Ethereum network using the send, transfer, or call functions in Solidity or other programming languages used to write smart contracts. When a message is sent, it is processed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and executed by the recipient account's contract code.

Messages can be used for a variety of purposes in Ethereum, such as transferring funds between accounts, triggering contract functions, or sending and receiving data between smart contracts. They are a core component of the Ethereum network and enable a wide range of decentralized applications to be built on top of the blockchain.
