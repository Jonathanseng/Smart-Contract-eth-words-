"Considered for Inclusion" is a term used in the software development process to describe a feature or change that has been proposed for inclusion in a future version of a software product. When a feature or change is considered for inclusion, it means that the development team has evaluated the proposal and deemed it worthy of further consideration.

The application of "Considered for Inclusion" is particularly important in open-source software development, where anyone can propose changes or new features to the software. In this context, "Considered for Inclusion" means that the development team has evaluated the proposed change or feature and has determined that it aligns with the project's goals and meets the project's standards for quality and functionality.

When a proposal is "Considered for Inclusion," it may undergo further review and testing to ensure that it meets the project's requirements and does not introduce new bugs or vulnerabilities into the software. If the proposal passes these tests and meets the project's criteria, it may be merged into the main codebase and included in the next release of the software.

Overall, "Considered for Inclusion" is an important part of the software development process, particularly in open-source projects. It allows the development team to evaluate proposed changes and features and determine whether they are a good fit for the project, which helps to ensure the quality and functionality of the software.
