Discovery is a pre-trial phase in a legal proceeding where parties involved gather and exchange information and evidence related to the case. The primary objective of discovery is to ensure a fair and efficient trial by allowing each party to obtain evidence that is relevant to the case and prepare their arguments accordingly.

Discovery has several applications, including:

Fact-finding: Discovery allows both parties to gather relevant information and evidence related to the case. This can include witness statements, documents, and other materials that can help establish the facts of the case.

Preparing arguments: Discovery helps both parties to prepare their arguments and anticipate the arguments of the opposing side. This can lead to a more efficient and effective trial.

Settlement negotiations: Discovery can also be used as a tool for settlement negotiations. If the parties involved in the case can reach an agreement based on the evidence gathered during discovery, they may be able to avoid a lengthy trial.

Resolving disputes: Discovery can also be used to resolve disputes before a trial begins. If the parties involved in the case can agree on the relevant evidence, they may be able to resolve the case through mediation or other alternative dispute resolution methods.

Overall, discovery plays a crucial role in ensuring a fair and efficient legal proceeding. By allowing parties to gather and exchange relevant information and evidence, discovery helps to establish the facts of the case, prepare arguments, and potentially avoid a trial altogether.
