Supermajority is a term used in politics and decision-making to refer to a requirement for a larger-than-usual majority to pass a particular motion or proposal. The definition of supermajority can vary depending on the specific context and the rules in place.

In many cases, a supermajority is a requirement that is higher than the simple majority of 50% plus one vote. For example, a two-thirds supermajority would require at least two-thirds of the votes in favor of a motion or proposal in order for it to be approved. Other common supermajority requirements include three-fifths or three-fourths of the votes.

Supermajority requirements are often used to ensure that decisions are made with a high level of agreement and consensus, particularly in situations where the stakes are high or the outcome could have significant consequences. For example, some constitutions require a supermajority vote to amend the document, in order to prevent frequent or drastic changes to the fundamental structure of government.

Supermajority requirements can also be used in corporate governance, where they may be required to approve certain types of decisions, such as mergers and acquisitions or changes to the company's bylaws. In general, supermajority requirements are seen as a way to balance the need for efficient decision-making with the need for consensus and legitimacy in the decision-making process.
