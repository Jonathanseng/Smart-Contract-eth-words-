In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance and provides global access to that instance. This is often used when there is a need for a single instance of a class that can coordinate actions across a system, such as a configuration manager or a logging service.

The singleton pattern typically involves the following steps:

Define a class: The singleton class is defined as a regular class, with a private constructor and a private static instance variable.

Create a public static method: The singleton class also includes a public static method that provides access to the singleton instance. This method checks if an instance of the class has been created, and if not, it creates one and returns it.

Restrict instantiation: The singleton class also ensures that no other instances of the class can be created by marking the constructor as private.

Here's an example of a singleton class in Java:

In this example, the Singleton class has a private constructor, which ensures that no other instances of the class can be created. The getInstance method provides global access to the singleton instance, and creates a new instance if one does not already exist.

Note that while the singleton pattern can be useful in certain cases, it can also introduce issues such as global state and tight coupling between components. It's important to carefully consider the trade-offs and potential drawbacks of using the singleton pattern in your software design.
