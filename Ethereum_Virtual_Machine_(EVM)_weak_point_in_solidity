As a language model, I can't state the opinion about Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) or Solidity. However, I can provide some general information about potential weaknesses of the EVM and Solidity that have been identified by experts in the field.

One potential weakness of the EVM is its gas model, which is used to measure the amount of computational work required to execute a given transaction or contract. The gas model is designed to prevent infinite loops and other types of resource exhaustion attacks, but it can be difficult to estimate the gas cost of a particular operation, leading to potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, the gas model can be used to create denial-of-service attacks by forcing users to pay exorbitant amounts of gas to execute a transaction.

Another potential weakness of the EVM is its lack of support for certain types of operations, such as floating-point arithmetic. This can make it difficult to write certain types of applications, and can also lead to vulnerabilities if developers attempt to implement these operations using workarounds that are not fully secure.

In terms of Solidity, one potential weakness is the risk of coding errors, which can lead to vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Solidity is a relatively new language, and developers may not have extensive experience in writing secure code in this language. Additionally, Solidity has a number of features that can be difficult to use correctly, such as the "fallback" function, which can be used to send ether to a contract without specifying a specific function to call.

Another potential weakness of Solidity is its lack of formal verification tools, which can make it difficult to ensure that a smart contract behaves correctly under all possible conditions. While there are some tools available for verifying Solidity contracts, they are still relatively new and may not be widely used.
