Solidity is a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Inline assembly is a feature of Solidity that allows low-level programming and interaction with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) directly.

Inline assembly in Solidity enables developers to write EVM bytecode directly in their Solidity code. This provides more control and flexibility over the generated bytecode and allows for more efficient and optimized code execution.

Here's an example of Solidity code using inline assembly:

In this example, the add function uses inline assembly to call the add EVM opcode to add two numbers. The assembly keyword is used to indicate that the following code is inline assembly code, and the add opcode is called with the a and b arguments passed as input.

Inline assembly in Solidity should be used with caution, as it requires a deep understanding of the EVM and can be error-prone. It's recommended that developers only use inline assembly when necessary and thoroughly test their code to ensure it works as expected.
