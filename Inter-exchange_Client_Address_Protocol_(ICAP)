Unfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, I am not familiar with the Inter-exchange Client Address Protocol, and it's unclear what kind of functionality it provides. Therefore, I cannot provide Solidity code for it.

If you could provide more information about the protocol and its purpose, I may be able to help you better. Alternatively, you may need to consult the documentation or resources for the specific protocol to find Solidity code examples or implementations.
